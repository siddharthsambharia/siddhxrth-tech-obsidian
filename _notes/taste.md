title: how to develop good taste for work
---
# WIP ðŸš§

This essay is inspired by 2 things: 
1. My CEOs comment on some work that i did, which was okayy imo. but he asked me to do it again. maybe all i lagged there was taste for my job.
2. This essay is in continuation of Anu Alturu's essay- Taste is eating Silicon Valley. I highly recommend reading this, this is the essay that gave genesis to the one i am gonna write

All the things that we do at work falls in either of the 2 categories:
1. Make it efficient
2. Make it good. what does good mean? make it taste better

the type 1 jobs that we do includes: 
1. coding
2. automation
3. lead search
Or anything that is meant to be on the background of the company. once you have defined the end goal, how you reach there doesn't really matter. what matters is the desired output in the most efficient manner. But even if you do get there by 10% less efficient way. things will be okay still

the type 2 jobs have no one-size fits all answer. whatever you do in type 2 jobs needs more 'taste'. i can write a long list of tasks that we need to do , where most of the people can do 60-70% of the job. but the rest 30-40% is depends on how well can you do your job.
1. doing sales
2. writing customer emails
3. UI/UX
4. branding
5. writing blogs/docs 

and so on... in this case you don't know what the right answer is, you know what can be wrong but you have no idea what is the most correct answer. i think this is something that i need to get good at and this blog serves as my thoughts on how do you do that. 



To study taste we need to look at the Crypto Bros. they created a whole community based on 2-3 acronyms: BUIDL WGMI, NGMI and so on. 


I was just scrolling to Paul Graham's writing to procrastinate writing: but this is what i found: https://paulgraham.com/goodtaste.html


This solves the need to who why is there a taste in anything. I would go to such an extent to say everything that you do in life has *taste*.



There is one more article by paulg: https://www.paulgraham.com/taste.html

here is my summary to (although the source is a better idea to read)

- **Good Design is simple**: When you're forced to be simple, you're forced to face the real problem. When you can't deliver ornament, you have to deliver substance.

- **Good design is timeless.** 

- **Good design solves the right problem**: A lot of bad design is industrious, but misguided. In the mid twentieth century there was a vogue for setting text in sans-serif fonts. These fontsÂ _are_Â closer to the pure, underlying letterforms. But in text that's not the problem you're trying to solve. For legibility it's more important that letters be easy to tell apart. It may look Victorian, but a Times Roman lowercase g is easy to tell from a lowercase y.

- **Good design is suggestive**: In software, it means you should give users a few basic elements that they can combine as they wish, like Lego

- **Good design is often slightly funny** -I DONT KNOW ABOUT THIS

- **Good design is hard**

- **Good design looks easy**
